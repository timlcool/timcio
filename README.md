# Building a Progressive Web App
This is the repository for my course Building a Progressive Web App. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-progressive-web-app?trk=insiders_6787408_learning) and [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Building-Progressive-Web-App/518052-2.html)

Native apps do things like work offline and load on a device's home screen. Until now, mobile web apps accessed in a browser lacked those features. Progressive web apps correct these shortcomings. A progressive web app—like the one you build in this course—is 1) fast loading 2) responsive 3) able to work offline using service workers, 4) secure using HTTPS, and 5) installable using a special manifest. Ray Villalobos takes you the extra steps to make your web apps progressive, using a custom version of the Bootstrap framework and modals and templating system called Handlebars. Follow along to learn how to create interactive navigation, dynamic and responsive content such as carousels and multimedia, offline capabilities with service workers, and a more integrated launch experience with an app manifest file.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
